      <td>2013</td>
      <td>I just got my Associates in Criminal Justice. So I was thinking to myself hmm,
I should try computer programming. So I did just that and tried it, I forgot how much money
it was for that semester but I flunked out because I didn't have the patience at the time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2014</td>
      <td>So many changes was going on at this time. I had just got a new job as a Sociotherapist
in a nonprofit organization. I got kicked out of my house, was living with a friend for a little bit and me
and my gf at the time was going through. So life was pretty stressful.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2015</td>
      <td>My aunt died and she was a big part of my life. She and my grandmother basically raised me.
So at this time I felt like I only had myself and it was a good feeling. My life was spiraling out of control.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2016</td>
      <td>I had just started trading foreign currency and I was feeling like the man because I had it
down packed after about 3 months. One day I left a trade open because I took a nap. (sigh) I had no stop loss set.
My account was blown, I was f*** it, I have nothing else going on at the moment I'm leaving to go to the military.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2017</td>
      <td>I was living in Europe this year and having the time of my life while being in modern day
slavery. But the fact that I was doing it in EU had me feeling a little bit better about the situation. 
If anyone asked me should they join the Army I'd tell them not to be a mechanic.
